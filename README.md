 Hi, My Name is Vinícius Kwasinski and I came from a Brazilian Forest where I was born and for a random coincidence started studying electronics and informatics with books I found in a old shelf.

I'm most interested in Linux, Perl, PHP, and JS  when talking about technology and when it comes to hobbies in life I'm realy into Karate which I achived the 2nd degree of the black belt, so far, and this helped a lot achive another things in life including self-balance and concentration.
